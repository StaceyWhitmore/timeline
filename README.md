Timeline using React and D3
===========================

## A small react app that renders a timeline from an array of years and their corresponding events. I used the [D3 Library](https://d3js.org/) to create the domain (e.g. 1879-1964) and range (50 - 450)  and construct a scale() function to  interpolate pixel values from years.
